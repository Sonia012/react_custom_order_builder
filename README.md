# Description

This is the last project we did (in April 2019) after learning a new subject (React) during our BeCode training. This was a pairing exercice project.  Below, you'll find the instructions that we received (from BeCode) for this project.

# Technologies used

- React

## Learning objectives 

The purpose of this challenge is to get acquainted with the *state* and re-using *components*.

Team challenge : `duo`

## The Mission
The manager of a restaurant in the neighbourhood wants to modernize his business and you have been contacted to ensure this runs smoothly.

Example:
In your client's cocktail bar, creative customers can put together their own cocktail. They can pass on their exact quantities to the waiter, who in turn informs the bartender.

However, the manager wants to make his business hipper and more digital and wants every table to be able to send his orders digitally to the bartender.

From an initial conversation with the manager you were able to get the following information:
### Must-have features
- The customer must see a list of all possible ingredients
- This list is logically divided into different categories (spirits, soft drinks, garnishes, ...)
- A new 'empty' cocktail can be created, that the customer can fill with the ingredients of their choice
- The price of the cocktail is automatically updated when adding or removing ingredients
- When the customer has put together 1 or more cocktails and wants to order, an overview is given of the order.

### Nice-to-have features
- The customer chooses the quantity of each ingredient
- Own creations can be saved (this makes it easier to order them again)
- The customer can provide a written message with his order
- ...

# Progress
Due to time constraints and a tight deadline, we have focused on the functionality and not on the design. We believe we managed to fulfill all the "Must-haves" and even one "Nice-to-have" (customer can choose the quantity of each ingredient). We could still improve this app by adding other nice-to-haves and adding some CSS to make it look nicer.
